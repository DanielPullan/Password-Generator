# Password Generator

Probably not secure as in "trust your life" on it secure, but secure as in "as least it's not using the same temp password for everybody" secure.

## Directions

Add the words you want into the text files, be mindful of adding spaces (unless you want them I guess).

Run the script, it auto copies the result to your clipboard, I may add an option to not have that in the future. Depends on user feedback I guess, it's not hard to implement at all.

## Warning

Do not use this for super important mission critical passwords. I can't imagine someone in that position would use this, but seriously, this is intended for temp passwords for accounts that ultimately don't matter. The usecase for these passwords is they're going to end up written on a post-it note and the password immediately changed (Thank <insert $higherPowerName here> for "User must change password on logon" in AD).
